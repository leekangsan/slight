#Slight

Slight's an in-browser document editor. It saves content using local storage, so it can be recalled the next time Slight is opened. It's got a minimal interface, so you can just focus on writing. I would love to get a URL for it, but for now I'll just leave it here. Slight is an active work-in-progress.

Slight uses the Source font family by Adobe, available *completely free* for web use at https://edgewebfonts.adobe.com!
